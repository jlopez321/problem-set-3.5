    <h2 style="color:darkblue;"">Introduction</h2>
      <p>The modern world of console gaming has been steadily improving and evolving ever since it was concieved. As <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-consoles">TechRadar puts it</a>,
        console gaming back in the day was simple:</p>
        <div><p>"The decision was made by which games you wanted to play - Mario fans always went
        Nintendo and Sonic fans went Sega. Done!"</p></div>
        <p>A path paved by Nintendo and Atari with their early home consoles, console gaming
        nowadays is a fierce competition between three powerhouses in gaming;Sony with their Playstation 4, Microsoft with the Xbox One,
        and Nintendo with their hybrid console the Nintendo Switch. The following pages will delve deeper into each corner of the arena
        that is console gaming.</p>
        <h2 class="what">What is Console Gaming?</h2>
        <p>A console game is a form of interactive multimedia used for entertainment. The game consists of manipulable images
          (and usually sounds) generated by a video game console and displayed on a television or similar audio-video system.
           The game itself is usually controlled and manipulated using a handheld device connected to the console, called a
           controller. The controller generally contains a number of buttons and directional controls, (such as analogue
           joysticks), each of which has been assigned a purpose for interacting with and controlling the images on the screen.
            The display, speakers, console, and controls of a console can also be incorporated into one small object known as
            a handheld game.</p>
